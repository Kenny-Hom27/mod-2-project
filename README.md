# README

Welcome to Keystone!

This project was created using Ruby on Rails with the full MVC pattern and a lot of many to many relationships.

The first step is to create a user.

Once you are logged in, you can search for an architecture by name, city, style or artist.

You can also see all the Architectural pieces in a certain city, or created by a certain artists.

You can write reviews about an architecture, add a new architecture or edit a current architecture/review.

Enjoy!
